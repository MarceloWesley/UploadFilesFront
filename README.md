# About

I did this project to study a component composition pattern, react-query and some techniques to improve the code.
This project consists of the front-end of a file upload, I made it with a minimalist layout as the focus was on studying some features and how to apply them.


## Cloning the Project
If you want to clone the project, just copy the ssh key and write "git clone (ssh key)" in your terminal,  and with the project open, open your editor's terminal and type ```yarn``` to install the dependencies, 
after that, type ```yarn dev``` to run the project.
